I recently purchased a used Mac mini from Xianyu, 2020 M1 version. I chose the lowest configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which cost around $3,600 at the time. It has been used for about a month now, and it has set up functions such as bypass routing, remote Time Machine backup, SMB file sharing, remote desktop connection, intranet penetration, etc. It can be said that it is worth the money.

## The Hardware Configuration of the 2020 M1 Mac mini

Mac mini is Apple's small mainframe, similar to the Intel® NUC mini PC. It doesn't come with a keyboard, mouse, or monitor, so it's also more affordable than an iMac.

This generation of Mac mini is the first Mac mini equipped with Apple Silicon, based on the ARM architecture, it has a better energy consumption ratio and better performance. Its Geekbench 4 score of 7422 was higher than the 5488 for the top Intel-based Mac mini. However, limited by the M1 chip, it only has two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of four, and it only supports connecting up to two monitors. However, compared to the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro with the M1 chip, it has more ports - it has an additional HDMI 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet port (upgradable to 10Gb Ethernet port) and two USB-A ports.

Personally, I think the positioning of Mac mini is greater than or equal to MacBook Air, and less than or equal to iMac and MacBook Pro series. So in the future, Apple may also launch a Mac mini with the M1 Pro/M1 Max chip.

## Some Settings that Need to be Modified as a Server

### Automatic log-in

Automatic login is a very important feature. Enabling automatic login allows you to automatically log in to the user interface and start related services without entering a password after updating macOS and restarting the computer. It can be said that it is a function that must be turned on when using Mac mini as a server, especially a remote server. For the specific operation method, please refer to [this document](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT201476). [Disable FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) is required to enable this feature.

### Configure Firewall and Router

The sharing feature of macOS listens on all network interfaces. If your carrier provides public IPv4, you can expose SMB to the public network through port forwarding or DMZ hosts. If IPv6 access is required, you need to turn off the optical modem and the firewall on the router to allow incoming IPv6 connections from the outside.

### Remote Login and Remote Management

Enabling remote login and remote management not only makes it easy to remotely manage the Mac mini, but also directly uses the macOS environment to execute applications. After enabling remote login, you can use SSH connection. After enabling remote management, you can connect to the remote screen.

On macOS/iOS, I use Screens to remotely connect to the Mac mini. If you're using it on an iPad, I recommend installing SwitchResX to customize the screen resolution for a perfect fit on the iPad. It should be noted that there may be a part of the safety distance at the bottom of the iPad, which needs to be subtracted when setting the resolution. On my 11-inch iPad Pro, there's a 40-pixel safety margin at the bottom. In addition to the resolution, I also lowered the refresh rate to 30Hz to reduce the stress on the network transmission.

![Remote screen connection is perfect for iPad](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/4f900ecb-ef9f-417d-6919-6c1918202500/large)

It should be noted that before enabling remote login and remote management, be sure to set a strong password for your Mac, otherwise the password may be brute force cracked.

With a remote connection, Final Cut Pro can even be used on an iPad. After my actual experience, when controlling via Internet connection in the same city, I do not feel any obvious lag, and it is completely usable. Note that the screen width must be greater than 1280px (2560 pixels for HiDPI) when using Final Cut Pro. You can use SwitchResX to automatically switch resolutions based on the application. The screenshot below was zoomed on an 11-inch iPad Pro, so it's slightly blurry.

## Mac mini as NAS

The file sharing feature of macOS can directly turn the Mac mini into a NAS. Just open System Preferences - Sharing, then enable "File Sharing", and NAS is ready. Macs use the SMB protocol. A wired network is recommended for stability.

![enable "file sharing"](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/ea933d8a-e281-47b8-19d3-d39ed72c8e00/large)

Note that you may need to go into advanced options and then enable "Windows File Sharing" to connect SMB on some clients.

![Enable "Windows File Sharing"](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/25b3b5d7-342c-40e3-f1ad-aea9078be500/large)

If you want to allow guest access, you not only need to add "anyone" to the user, but also need to turn on "Allow guest users" in the advanced options. Also, "Allow guest users to connect to shared folders" needs to be enabled in System Preferences - Users & Groups - Guest Users. At this time, you can connect to SMB with the username "Guest" and the password empty.

![Advanced options](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/6a5e42fb-ed00-4860-5387-77a8be44a600/large)

### Shared External Hard Drive

The Thunderbolt 3 and USB Type-A ports of the Mac mini are very suitable for connecting external hard drives. The connected external hard drives can also be shared through file sharing. Just add the external hard drive to the "Shared Folder".

#### Build RAID and Fusion Drive

I have RAID and Fusion Drive configured for my external hard drive. I used 4x 3TB 3.5" HDDs and a 1TB SSD. Four of the HDDs are connected to the Mac mini using a four-bay hard drive enclosure using USB Type-A ports, and the SSDs are connected to the Mac mini using a Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 hard drive enclosure. I did RAID5 on the hard drive enclosure, turning 4 3TB HDDs into 9TB of storage. Then on top of that, a Fusion Drive was used to fuse it with an SSD, eventually reaching a capacity of 10TB. I refer to [this article](https://www.econtechnologies.com/chronosync/tn-cs-apfs-fusion-drive.html) for the Fusion Drive configuration method.

I chose to use APFS as the file system. Mainly because the new version of macOS no longer supports new HFS+ encrypted partitions, and because of the blessing of SSD, I am not very worried about performance degradation.

### As Time Machine Backup Destination

Also in the advanced options, turn on "Share as a Time Machine backup destination". On the Mac that needs to be backed up, use Go - Connect to Server (⌘K) in the Finder menu bar to connect to this Mac, then you can find the via file in Time Machine in System Preferences shared folder.

![connect server](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/fe1282c9-8f57-439c-5777-f3b8591b7400/large)

I'm currently doing offsite backups with an internet connection to the Mac mini, the first backup took about 6 hours, and every subsequent backup was completed within half an hour. I also added an HDD connected via USB, and the system will use two disks for alternate backup, successfully implementing one off-site backup, three storage media and three copies, in line with the [Backup 3-2-1 principle](https:/ /guozeyu.com/2018/08/backup/#Best Backup Principles: 321-Principles).

### Backup Data on NAS

For better security, data on the NAS can also be backed up. I chose to use the Carbon Copy Cloner installed on the Mac mini to back up some important data on the NAS to the AirPort Time Capsule on the local LAN. I chose to back up to a Sparse Bundle on the APFS filesystem for snapshots and encryption.

![Configuration of Carbon Copy Cloner](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/f8a66501-4fb6-40d5-2a42-0f624f1a4e00/large)

### Sync Photos - Lightroom Classic CC

Thanks to this 10TB NAS, I decided to switch my Adobe subscription from Lightroom (1TB) to Photography (20GB). Photography (20GB) has more Photoshop CC and Lightroom Classic CC than Lightroom (1TB). Among them, Lightroom Classic CC uses the local photo library and can also be synchronized with Lightroom CC. I installed Lightroom Classic CC on my Mac mini, turned on sync, saved all my previous Lightroom CC images locally, and unsynced them on Lightroom Classic CC. Soon, all my cloud space was freed up. Then I add the photos back to the sync folder. At this point, Lightroom Classic CC will only upload smart previews of these photos (that is, in relatively low-resolution RAW format), which do not take up cloud storage space. In the future, when Lightroom CC runs out of space again, I can still use this method to free up Lightroom CC space.

![Sync without cloud space](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/ced7d45a-1d3b-46f6-4b91-293f8afdcc00/large)

Now I can edit photos on any of my devices with Lightroom CC installed. However, Lightroom Classic CC on the Mac mini is still required if the original image needs to be exported. In order to be able to export the original image on other desktop devices, I need to have on the other device - 1. the original image file, 2. the library. I choose to use ChronoSync Express for two-way timing synchronization of the original image files, and use iCloud Drive to synchronize the library (including standard preview, 1:1 preview, and smart preview). After my actual test, I found that iCloud supports incremental synchronization, that is, only the changed file blocks in the library file will be synchronized after each modification to the library.

Note that the `Lightroom Catalog*` files must be in the same directory. If necessary, soft links can be used to store their original files in different locations. I generally store raw files on an external hard drive to save space on this machine. Editing with Smart Preview is still possible when an external hard drive is unavailable.

## Bypass Routing

I use Surge's DHCP server for bypass routing. Surge can take over the request on the LAN device, and it is very convenient to rewrite, capture, decrypt, proxy, etc. The DHCP server on the router/light modem needs to be turned off.

![Surge's DHCP](https://imagedelivery.net/6T-behmofKYLsxlrK0l_MQ/4c6c836e-29fe-4557-5fdb-8dd5d1e8b900/large)

Turn on Surge's enhanced mode, then right-click on the device in the DHCP page, and turn on "Use Surge as a gateway". Reconnect that device to the network and its traffic will be taken over by Surge.

## Intranet Penetration

Also using Surge, add the following to its configuration file:

```
[Snell Server]
interface = ::
port = 6160
psk = SOME_RANDOM_PASSWORD
obfs = off
ipv6=true
```

Then, add the following proxy configuration to Surge on other devices:

```
[Proxy]
Mac mini = snell, mac-mini.sgddns, 6160, psk=SOME_RANDOM_PASSWORD, udp-relay=true, tfo=true

[Rule]
IP-CIDR, 192.168.1.0/24, Mac mini
```

You need to change `SOME_RANDOM_PASSWORD` to a random string, and change `192.168.1.0/24` to your intranet IP segment. Now, intranet penetration can be achieved.

## Downloader - qBittorrent

I recommend using qBittorrent as a downloader. Its built-in web UI makes it easy to control qBittorrent on other devices.

## Mac mini alternative

Some people may feel that using a Raspberry Pi will do. In fact, the Raspberry Pi can do most of the functions, but it does not have a macOS environment to install software such as Lightroom Classic CC, Final Cut Pro, etc.

Of course, a Windows host such as an Intel® NUC can be used in place of the Mac mini to achieve a similar effect.
